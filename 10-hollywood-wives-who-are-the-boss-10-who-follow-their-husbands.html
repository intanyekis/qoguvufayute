Couples can be either submissive or dominant. If a couple understands each other, they will live happily ever after, regardless of anything else. We have studied and found some couples who have a dominant wife or a husband. Generally,&nbsp;celeb wives dominate at home, but there are exceptional cases of a careerist woman who wants her husband to be the boss of the house and also direct their lives. There is nothing more pleasurable than when your man who cares for you can decide on your life, at least for those women. Other celebs feel differently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whatever it is, the ultimate motto is to have a peaceful life. There is usually only one person who has all the authority so that it does not create confusion. So, we have studied and found twenty couples&nbsp;where the husbands are the bosses and others where the wives dominate the scenario. It’s interesting to know that there are pros and cons of both sides. But how they manage and what is their formula to a peaceful life is interesting.</p><p>Couples definitely have their own way of navigating their lives, separately and together, but it is still interesting to see what it is that they do to have a healthy and happy home life.</p><h2 id=boss---amal-doesn-t-like-separation>BOSS - AMAL DOESN'T LIKE SEPARATION</h2><p>When George and Amal got married, the world was shocked. For a long time, George remained a playboy, so to see him settle down with the right person was mindblowing. While Martha Stewart Weddings was interviewing George, George said that he feels more humble now that he has settled down, even though it took a long time. He's just happy he found his wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that he has found himself his longtime partner, he has no problem giving himself completely to her. All Amal wants is that George should stay with her and give her some quality time. They have a home in London, and George prefers to stay there and do all film-related jobs like writing scripts, deciding on productions and more. Amal wants him around constantly, and so that's just how it has to be.</p><p>This Hollywood wife sets strict rules to her man, and she makes sure he follows them. George himself is probably so in love that the whole thing doesn't matter to him. He is likely just happy to be with someone for the long run, after all this time.</p><h2 id=follow-their-husbands---meghan-markle-follows-royal-protocols>follow their husbands - MEGHAN MARKLE FOLLOWS ROYAL PROTOCOLS</h2><p>The&nbsp;biggest marriage of 2018 will be Meghan and Prince Harry’s, no matter who gets married after them. She is a new&nbsp;member of the Royal family and needs the Queen’s blessings for her new life, but she has to sacrifice a lot for it. She had to abide Queen’s orders and follow the Royal protocol strictly. She cannot&nbsp;give her autograph or continue communicating with her fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She can’t wear short skirts or swimming suits. She has to wear stockings and a particular shade of dress every time she makes a public appearance. Looks like she had to make a lot of sacrifices to be a part of this family. Although she knows that her children would never be the heir to the Royal throne, she has to accept that now, so that it does not bother her later. She cannot eat before the Queen starts her meal and cannot continue after the Queen finishes her meal. She has to follow all weird rules just to be the wife of Prince Harry, and she will have to follow them strictly. She can't really cry about it either, she knew what she was getting herself into.</p><h2 id=boss---behati-prinsloo-laid-down-strict-rules-for-adam-levine>BOSS - BEHATI PRINSLOO LAID DOWN STRICT RULES FOR ADAM LEVINE</h2><p>Adam Levine is a popular singer, and he is married to Behati Prinsloo, a woman of South African origin who was a Victoria Secret model for some time. They are parents to two children now. When the Martha Stewart Wedding interviewed Levine, he said that he always believes in listening to the woman of his house.&nbsp;He does whatever she wants so that he continues to make her feel very good, and doesn't step on her authority.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prinsloo seems to be a strict wife and sets rules for her husband and children. The woman of the house always has a right to announce rules for the family members. As far as Adam goes, he seems content in just leading the group of Maroon 5 and is also a great advocate of power yoga. They seem to be a very stable family, all things considered. They don't want to step on each other's toes, and while she cares for the house and the children while he is working, it seems to work okay with the two of them. Some people might see it as too traditional, but it definitely works for them.</p><h2 id=follows-her-husband---emily-blunt-doesn-t-want-to-make-john-mad>follows her husband - EMILY BLUNT DOESN'T WANT&nbsp;to make john mad</h2><p>Emily Blunt is married to John Krasinski, and they are one of the power couples of Hollywood. They are a perfect match and a ‘made for each other’ couple. They have their schedules and are quite busy, but they find time for each other&nbsp;regardless of that. One of the best theories she follows to date is leaving her husband the way he is. She never crosses his way or tries to dominate him. She believes in full freedom and quotes some examples of her friends who are living happily&nbsp;as they allow space for the other to grow. She believes in trusting her partner and disbelieves in domination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to her philosophy, marriage is a bond of trust, and she would never take a chance to break the trust by imposing strange rules on her husband. She also expects to be treated in the same way. She is a career woman and tries to maintain that to the best of her ability.</p><p>Emily is an example of a modern woman who loves her career as well as her spouse and does not believe in strangulating her relationship with weird rules. Looks like women need to learn&nbsp;a lesson from her.</p><h2 id=boss---blake-lively-believes-in-creating-a-hospitable-environment-for-the-kids>BOSS - BLAKE LIVELY BELIEVES IN CREATING A HOSPITABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE KIDS</h2><p>Blake Lively is married to Ryan Reynolds, and when we talk about listing power couples, they definitely hold the number one spot. They are a talented couple and have worked on&nbsp;fantastic projects in the past. Now, that they have children, Blake has some strict rules for Ryan and the children to follow. When Elite Daily interviewed Ryan Reynolds, he said that they are conscious that they are parents&nbsp;and they make sure they act accordingly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Blake and Ryan come from big families, and they want to create a friendly atmosphere for the kids. They are very particular about the fact that their work does not overlap each other. They know that everything comes secondary to parenting. They each have to plan their jobs around their children, making sure that either one of them can be with them, or put everything aside until that point.</p><p>Blake Lively is very particular that Ryan should follow some rules and duties towards the family especially the kids. Afterall,&nbsp;that is what makes a close-knit family.</p><h2 id=follows-her-husband---meryl-streep-believes-in-bending-in-marriage>follows her husband - MERYL STREEP BELIEVES IN "BENDING" IN MARRIAGE</h2><p>Meryl Streep is no doubt one of the best actors we have today, and she is married to Don Gummer, an American sculptor. She has won Oscars for her stunning performances and dedicated acting efforts. There are a lot of untold stories about her family and also personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The marriage is not between two Hollywood actors, it’s just between two creative people. She said in an interview taken by Hollywood Reporter that the secret of happy marriage is just goodwill and willingness to bend to the situations presented to her, and the tendency to shut up everybody who wants to criticize her. Meryl Streep is a reputed and powerful woman, and she knows how to shut down any controversy in her life.</p><p>Meryl is a strong woman, and she believes in love more than comfort. She has married the man she loved the most and never lets him feel as though he is trapped or choking in their relationship. Meryl is a celebrity and married a normal man. She thus proved that trust and commitment come above everything in a relationship.</p><h2 id=boss---chrissy-teigen-is-a-strict-wife>BOSS - CHRISSY TEIGEN is a strict wife</h2><p>Chrissy Teigen and John Legend are a famous couple&nbsp;in Hollywood. They are quite open in terms of relationship goals and&nbsp;have expressed that they had tough times while conceiving children. They follow some important rules that help them to frame their family in a well-knit manner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Elle Magazine interviewed John Legend, he mentioned that he always apologizes to his wife when something goes wrong. In fact, he prefers telling his wife that she is always right. John believes that the best way to end an argument is to tell your wife that she is right and that you are wrong. He even said that he is happy to see his wife as a successful woman.&nbsp;Whenever she does something, he is always proud.</p><p>In fact, to be a good husband and a family person, it’s essential to be a successful man in life, not just in your job. John has prioritized his wife and kids before anything else. In fact, Chrissy is a strict and a successful wife also, as she maintained her family in the most protective way.</p><h2 id=follows-her-husband---jada-pinkett-clarified-she-s-not-in-an-open-relationship-with-will>follows her husband - JADA PINKETT CLARIFIED SHE'S NOT IN AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP WITH WILL</h2><p>Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith are beloved by fans and Hollywood members alike. They also have successful children, and thus as a whole, they are just a well put together family. When the Huffington Post interviewed Jada, she said that Will is allowed to do anything he likes as long as he looks in the mirror and says that he is okay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jada says that her husband has to decide whom he wants to be, and it’s not necessary that he has to be the man she wants. Her words at first were taken out of context, and the media thought they were in an open marriage. But, later Jada clarified and said that she and Will were not in an open marriage, but both allow each other to do whatever they want.</p><p>When US Weekly interviewed her again about it, she clarified her statement by saying that both of them trust and have confidence in each other. Jada is a confident woman, and she knows that giving a bit of liberty to&nbsp;her husband&nbsp;just means that she trusts him, and allows him to have a life separate from her.</p><h2 id=boss---faith-hill-dominating-but-sweet>BOSS - FAITH HILL dominating but sweet</h2><p>Faith Hill, a country singer, is married to Tim McGraw, who is also a singer. Faith is famous for her achievement&nbsp;with the Pearl Harbour soundtrack, and she achieved worldwide recognition for that. Both of them have recorded several duets and definitely are a power couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When People magazine interviewed Tim, he revealed the reason why he thinks Faith is a good wife--he said that he adores the qualities that she has. She is both a career woman and a strict wife. When Faith speaks about her husband, she says that Tim tolerates her a lot, noting that she is not the easiest person to deal with. It's interesting to note that Faith clearly admitted that she is a bit of dominating type. As a couple, they tolerate a lot and have great respect for each other.</p><p>The best part is that Tim never says anything negative about Faith. Faith can be a dominant wife and the best&nbsp;person to have at home all at the same time.&nbsp;At the end of the day, whatever works for them, works for us.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=follows-her-husband---candace-cameron-bure-the-submissive-wife>follows her husband - CANDACE CAMERON BURE THE SUBMISSIVE WIFE</h2><p>Candace Cameron Bure is married to ex-hockey player Valeri Bure, and they are a happy couple. While ABC News interviewed Candace, she said that she knows Valeri is a leader. She would prefer Valeri to lead the family and&nbsp;make all the major decisions. But that does not necessarily mean that Candace should not voice her opinion. She says that she likes to participate in any discussion related to her family members, including her children. Since she believes that it is difficult to have two heads of authority, she allows husband Valeri to take the final call.</p><p>They&nbsp;have been married for seventeen years, and the happy marriage is working well for both. Candace openly says that she is happy about Valeri’s ‘take charge’&nbsp;personality and firm decision-making abilities. She defines that being submissive is all about&nbsp;patience and it’s not about weakness.&nbsp;Candace says that she is not a submissive person, but she wants to do everything and anything that makes her family work.&nbsp;She is always ready to make a sacrifice, and in this case, it is making her husband call the shots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=boss---ellen-degeneres-does-not-like-secrets>BOSS - ELLEN DEGENERES&nbsp;does not like secrets</h2><p>Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi are the most debatable unconventional couple in Hollywood. While Entertainment Tonight interviewed them, Ellen said that she likes to be with Portia and that they are like best friends. The spouses have set strict rules with one another, but the most important being that they cannot lie to each other.</p><p>This is obviously a core thing in many relationships, because lying to your partner never ends up good. Being truthful with each other is most important, and it is what allows a couple to grow with each other. A relationship built on lies would never ever work, and so they avoided it from the get-go in order to have something real and honest with one another.</p><p>Even though they are different individuals, they have a mutual understanding with each other, and that is a must for any relationship. We don’t exactly know who set this rule of ‘no lying.’ It might be Portia or DeGeneres, but one fact is true that the basic rule of openness is an admirable quality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=follows-her-husband---monique-doesn-t-mind-if-sydney-flirts-with-others>follows her husband - MONIQUE DOESN'T MIND IF SYDNEY FLIRTS WITH OTHERS</h2><p>Monique, the standup comedian, is married to Sidney Hicks, and their relationship has seen headlines more than once. They created quite a stir online when Monique commented that she feels okay if her husband flirts with other women. When she was asked about why she accepted this weird practice, Monique says that she originates from Africa, and the kings there are known to have multiple wives instead of just one. Now that they have come to America, they have combined their life in America with practices of Africa.</p><p>Monique added that while Sidney is looking&nbsp;at another lady,&nbsp;she does not feel insecure about it. She knows that if she gives space to her husband, she is not doing anything wrong. A relationship is more or less like a kite; once you let it go, it will come back to you. Moreover,&nbsp;this husband and wife are also best friends. Spouse is more than a best friend, and a longtime friend will be adored throughout the life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=boss---fergie-sets-two-week-plans>BOSS - FERGIE SETS "TWO WEEK" PLANs</h2><p>Fergie, who’s a member of the group Black Eyed Peas, has proven her amazing talent as a singer many times. She’s an amazingly talented singer who went to pursue a solo career. It was during this time that she met her husband Josh Duhamel. The couple split after some time, but when Fergie was interviewed, she said that she had worked out some strict rules for her ex.</p><p>When US Weekly interviewed her, Fergie said that&nbsp;they used to attend marriage therapy. Fergie said that she and Josh had a two-week rule. Both of them were not allowed to stay more than two weeks without each other. They used to plan their work and holidays in such a way that the period of separation was never more than two weeks. Sometimes they planned their work in the presence of another.</p><p>Although Josh went to the marriage counselor many times, he says that Fergie is a strong person and he used to abide by her rules.&nbsp;May that be the reason why they weren't able to go the full distance?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=follows-her-husband---melissa-gorga-believes-making-her-husband-feel-important>follows her husband - MELISSA GORGA BELIEVES&nbsp;making her husband feel important</h2><p>Melissa Gorga is a cool actress, and she is remembered for her role in ‘Real Housewives of New Jersey.’ The show is doing good and her husband Joseph Gorga plays a vital part in her life. According to Melissa, she feels it is quite cool to allow her husband to call the shots.</p><p>Melissa has admitted that there are some people who like to dominate their husbands, but Melissa is not the same. While she is not afraid to put her foot down and call the shots when she wants, she has a much easier time giving up control to her husband. Thankfully he doesn't make her do anything without her consent, which is what matters the most. That and the fact that they are okay with each other.&nbsp;She has the power to disagree with him, but most of the time finds she is okay with their relationship, and likes to make him feel like a man. While some people might disagree with this, all that matters is what works for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=boss---jessica-biel-enjoys-freedom-and-trust-from-timberlake>BOSS - JESSICA BIEL ENJOYS FREEDOM AND TRUST FROM TIMBERLAKE</h2><p>Timberlake and Jessica are one of the cutest couples in Hollywood. They are both focused on their careers, but have placed a special amount of attention on their family. Looks like Jessica Biel is the one in charge and Timberlake is concerned only to keep her happy. All his past quotes prove the fact that she wants to dominate at home and keep her family happy.</p><p>Timberlake testifies to the fact that his wife is treated well in marriage and he has to abide by some interesting rules. The rules are mainly towards parenting. Usually, they take care of their children in turns. When Martha Stewart Weddings interviewed Timberlake, he was quoted to say that he follows some strict rules for the family.</p><p>First, he makes her feel like she’s got everything she wants. The next rule was like she was allowed to do whatever she wishes and never has to give an explanation for what she does.
