style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>In the interview they cover a lot of topics from Guardians of the&nbsp;Galaxy and his movie career, details about his WWE Return, Daniel&nbsp;Bryan, Triple H, newer superstars he’s been impressed with, and even a&nbsp;bit of talk about his MMA match.</p><p>The following are interview highlights:</p><p>On his WWE Departure and Return:</p><p>“I left for very specific reasons and the reasons were because there&nbsp;were certain opportunities I wasn’t getting when I was with the&nbsp;company, and we were so locked down and I mean when you’re under&nbsp;contract with them you’re pretty much limited to the things you can&nbsp;do. &nbsp;You really can’t do anything else in the company without their&nbsp;say so and they weren’t…certain guys were getting opportunities that I&nbsp;wasn’t getting and I wasn’t real cool with that. &nbsp;So I left to&nbsp;accomplish certain things, and I felt like once I accomplished them, I&nbsp;always wanted to come back. &nbsp;At the end of the day I love professional&nbsp;wrestling.</p><p><span>We didn’t come back and demand a lot of money you know I didn’t&nbsp;say,’I’m not doing house shows I’m only doing Monday Night Raw.’ I&nbsp;mean I said, ‘I’ll do Smackdown, I’ll do house shows.’ “</span></p><p>On Daniel Bryan:</p><p>“For some reason I think people thought that I didn’t like Daniel&nbsp;Bryan or I had this personal thing. &nbsp;I said a comment, I had one&nbsp;comment about him when he first won the world heavyweight championship&nbsp;and I was like, I was in shock and I said, “Okay.” &nbsp;Because I just&nbsp;didn’t get it. &nbsp;The reason I didn’t get it because it was too soon and&nbsp;that’s my personal opinion. &nbsp;I felt it was way too soon and they did&nbsp;that constantly over and over. &nbsp;I thought they, they just slap the&nbsp;title on people like, way too fast. &nbsp;It’s like, I think sometimes that&nbsp;they used the title, I might get a little grief for saying it,&nbsp;sometimes I think they use the title to get guys over. &nbsp;I thought it&nbsp;just, they did it, it was premature. &nbsp;I never had a problem with him&nbsp;being you know, World Heavyweight Champion, I just thought that they&nbsp;did it way too fast.”</p><p>“Years ago, before everybody was you know on his jock, when they&nbsp;wanted me to job him out, and I was like, “Hell no.” &nbsp;He’s just too&nbsp;good. &nbsp;He had been coming around for years and I could never figure&nbsp;out why they didn’t give him a job, but he had come out and they&nbsp;wanted me to work a match with him, and squash him and I was like,&nbsp;“No, not gonna happen.” &nbsp;He’s way too good man, we could have a good&nbsp;match, and we did. &nbsp;I mean we gave ’em a version of what they wanted,&nbsp;but we gave ’em a hell of a match.”</p><p>On new superstars that impress him:</p><p>“I love Bray Wyatt. &nbsp;I love him. &nbsp;I love that whole gimmick, that&nbsp;whole Wyatt Family gimmick, but Bray I think he’s gonna be a huge&nbsp;star. &nbsp;I get caught up in this guy, man. &nbsp;When I watch him he’s one of&nbsp;those guys. &nbsp;He’s another guy, I mean he doesn’t look like a stud.&nbsp;He’s not a statue of a man, but he is athletic as you can get, that&nbsp;kid can move man. He is agile, he is a stud man. That kid is as an&nbsp;athlete. He gets when he cuts a promo, you just get sucked in man. &nbsp;He&nbsp;is hypnotizing. When I talk to him like personal, on a personal level,&nbsp;he’s one of those kids who’s not afraid to learn, he has no ego. &nbsp;He’s&nbsp;still learning and he knows he’s still learning and he’s not afraid to&nbsp;ask questions, and I think that’s why he’s going to be so good. &nbsp;Cause&nbsp;he’s this good right now and he still wants to learn.”</p><p>On his MMA fight:</p><p>“I’d like to fight again. the first one didn’t go like I wanted it to&nbsp;I mean I hate to say that, at fourty-five years old, but I would. It’s&nbsp;just the first one, it was a great experience, especially leading up&nbsp;to the fight. The last week was as disappointing because we lost my&nbsp;opponent. &nbsp;Then for some reason I felt completely confident up until&nbsp;the point that they closed the cage. [Laughs] And then I was like,&nbsp;What the hell am I doing here? And I just kinda froze man and I froze&nbsp;long enough for Vince to get a couple really good shots on me that I&nbsp;mean just made me really dizzy. I was a little disappointed in myself&nbsp;because I didn’t think I was going to get nervous. &nbsp;I did, I totally&nbsp;froze.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgJVtbHBtXZeutbXSrZhmrJGhuLR51rCcZqqVqcKzuoyapZ1lnaS%2Fpg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bazzi.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bazzi Net worth, Age: Kids, Weight, Wife, Bio-Wiki</a>
