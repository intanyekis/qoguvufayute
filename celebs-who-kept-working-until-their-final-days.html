Going from playing a cheeky brother to a leading man, Rooney spent decades in the business, bringing his name to hundreds of films, both in background and taking the lead. Rooney’s death in 2014 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at the age of 93</a> came as a shock to some, however, his work was far from done. At the time of his death, Rooney was involved in two films: Night at the Museum, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. While Night at the Museum released in 2014, his work as Mr. Louis in Jekyll and Hyde aired in 2017, three years after his passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=freddie-mercury-kept-love-alive><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Freddie Mercury Kept Love Alive</span></h2><p>The frontman of Queen underwent a painful and lengthy sickness prior to his final days. While the singer battled AIDS, he kept his work going, staying in the recording booth for as long as he was able to. His final time in the studio was assisted by a cane as Mercury was no longer able to stand for lengthy periods of time. His last recorded track, “Mother Love” was done in studio in May 1991 with bandmate and songwriter Brian May filling in on the last verse as Mercury was unable to do so. The singer passed only <a href=#>months later on November 24, 1991</a>.</p><h2 id=christopher-plummer-kept-up-with-his-passion><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Christopher Plummer Kept Up With His Passion</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Few actors maintain their health and passions long enough to keep going in their older age. Christopher Plummer worked through to age 91 and was mid-project with Canadian drama Departure when he passed away. The actor saw an astonishing three film releases in the year leading up to his death and, when asked why he continued working, was always quick to say <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“No, never retire.
