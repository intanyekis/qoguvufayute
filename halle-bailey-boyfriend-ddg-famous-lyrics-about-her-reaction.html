expect them to share details of the relationship in at least one song. In some cases, that can result in some beautiful and romantic love songs. For example, <a href=#>Justin Bieber's songs about Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez</a> are very moving. But every once in a while, a song comes out that doesn't paint the best or nicest picture of a relationship. That is definitely the case with DDG's "Famous."</p><p>While <a href=#>Halle Bailey is getting work thanks to The Little Mermaid</a>, all anyone can talk about is her boyfriend DDG's song. While he wrote about her, the lyrics aren't very pleasant. Here's how Halle Bailey really feels about the song "Famous."</p><h2 id=what-did-halle-bailey-39-s-boyfriend-ddg-say-about-her-in-his-song-quot-famous-quot>What Did Halle Bailey's Boyfriend DDG Say About Her In His Song "Famous"?</h2><p>Halle Bailey and Darryl Dwayne Grandberry Jr., who goes by DDG, began dating in early 2022. According to People, they shared that they were in a relationship in March 2022, but people wondered if they were together in January 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Bailey and her sibling Chloe Bailey have sung together under the name Chloe x Halle, Bailey has become more famous recently thanks to her role as Ariel in The Little Mermaid. Bailey also stars in the 2023 movies The Color Purple and The Line. It's fair to say that Bailey started dating DDG around the time that her acting career began really taking off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/th-image-template-42.jpg><p>In July 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DDG released his song "Famous"</a> which appears to be about Halle Bailey. According to E! News, the lyrics refer to the fact that she starred in The Little Mermaid and had an onscreen love interest.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Halle Bailey's Sister Chloe's Strained Relationship With Her Parents Changed The Little Mermaid's Star's Life?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The lyrics of the song are as follows: "Filmin' a movie now you kissing dudes / You know I love you a lot / I don't give a f--k if that s--t for promo / I don't wanna see this s--t no more. Why is y'all holdin' hands in the photo? / You know I'm insecure, that's a no-no."</p><p>Watching a partner have a love scene in a movie with another actor or actress isn't ever going to be easy. Many people can understand feeling strange or nervous about that. However, there are other lyrics in the song "Famous" that feel problematic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ddg.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the chorus of "Famous," DDG says, "I ain't even got enough time in a day for me to chase a b*tch / I don't even ask for much, I ask you to do the basic s--- / Hardest thing I did was fall in love with a famous b*tch."</p><p>Halle Bailey's fans were upset when they heard those lyrics, which makes sense considering how harsh they are.</p><h2 id=how-does-halle-bailey-feel-about-her-boyfriend-ddg-39-s-song-quot-famous-quot>How Does Halle Bailey Feel About Her Boyfriend DDG's Song "Famous"?</h2><p>Halle Bailey doesn't seem to have responded to her boyfriend DDG's song "Famous," at least not publicly. While her fanbase can only speculate here, she might not be concerned or upset about it. Maybe they've had conversations about it.</p><p>It's important to note, though, that DDG never actually said that he was thinking about Halle Bailey when he wrote "Famous." People just assume that the song is about her thanks to the timing of their romance and the song's release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/halle-bailey.jpg><p>Considering how the relationship began, though, it seems likely that DDG does understand that Halle Bailey has an acting career that means a lot to her. People reported that they began talking when he sent her a direct message on social media. He knew that she was an actress, and if he didn't want to date someone who was part of Hollywood, it seems unlikely that he would have reached out to her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Halle Bailey's Training Requirements To Play Ariel In The Little Mermaid Were Anything But Ordinary</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DDG talked about his song "Famous"</a> and according to Rap-up.com, he said that people shouldn't be upset about it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/does-halle-bailey-care-that-her-boyfriend-ddj-appeared-to-insult-her-in-his-hit-song-famous_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>DDG said, "I want yâall to know, listen, âFamousâ is just a song, okay? Itâs just music yâall. Just how movies is just movies, songs is just songs. Yâall gotta relax and worry about yâall own stuff, and itâs all entertainment. Itâs the entertainment business. Relax, calm down, chill out. You know it is what it is. Iâm used to getting hated on.â</p><p>However, even though DDG said that no one should take "Famous" that seriously, many people think that the couple's relationship must not be all that happy if he could write such harsh things about her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/halle-bailey-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the actress didn't seem to say anything about DDG's song "Famous," she has talked about her relationship with him.</p><p>In May 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Halle Bailey talked about DDG</a> in an interview with Glamour. She said that she knows that fans are going to talk, but she has to do her best to not think about that too much.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Chloe Bailey Hates Comparisons To Sister Halle</a></span></p><p>Bailey said, âItâs really funny how people look at you [as] still being this young girl, still being this innocent, untouchable thing.

For my peace and my sanity, I have to keep that private.â</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ddg-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In November 2022, DDG was interviewed by The Breakfast Club and he said that he was attending more industry events because of his relationship with Halle Bailey.</p><p>According to Complex.com, DDG said, âIâve never been with nobody thatâs like really motivated me like she do. Iâm seeing different sh*t. I ainât really been around this type of sh*t before, so itâs like, sheâs bringing me around shit that I ainât reallyâyou know what Iâm saying? âOh, this is crazy.

This is somebody thatâs really like â¦ I was my own person before her, but in a way, put me on to different sh*t."</p><p>DDG also sounded like he was really in love with Halle Bailey. He also mentioned that he thinks about marriage in the future. While it's understandable that people are upset about DDG's "Famous" song lyrics, it does sound like he cherishes his romance with Halle Bailey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqScmnqjrcilnLJlkqTGp77InqWdZZSZtG6ywKamrqtdocaztcKsZJqan6rBbrTEq2SrnZGYwaq7zWg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./hunter-clowdus-exits-all-american-after-claiming-he-felt-unwelcome.html>&#171;&nbsp;Hunter Clowdus Exits All American After Claiming He Felt Unwelcome</a>
