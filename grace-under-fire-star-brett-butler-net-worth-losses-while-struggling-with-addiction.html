Unlike <a href=#>Steven Tyler, who still has a $150 million fortune</a>, Butler's <strong>severe addiction</strong> took a toll not only on her well-being but also on her financial stability.</p><p>Butler's story was similar to <a href=#>Bradley Cooper's, wasting a fortune on his addictions before getting sober</a>, and <a href=#>Kelsey Grammer's addiction that caused drama on the set of Frasier</a>. After a series of personal struggles, Butler was forced to rely on <strong>crowdfunding </strong>just to afford her cost of living.</p><h2 id=how-did-brett-butler-lose-her-net-worth-and-become-broke>How Did Brett Butler Lose Her Net Worth And Become Broke?</h2><p>Brett Butler was earning $250,000 per episode as the star of the ABC sitcom Grace Under Fire. At the peak of her career in the mid-1990s, she amassed around a $25 million net worth from the show, but she lost it all due to what she describes as profligate spending and financial carelessness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/th-image-template-21.jpg><p>Butler told The Hollywood Reporter:</p><p>"I was a little bit too trusting with some people that worked for me, and I had a lot of things stolen. That's just stupid on my part, not to have insurance for those things. And to loan and give a lot of money away. I really just felt so guilty for having it — I almost couldn't get rid of it fast enough."</p><p>Butler initially relied on a promised Grace Under Fire DVD deal worth $1 million, but the deal never materialized. She hoped for a comeback, but Butler's sporadic TV appearances yielded significantly less income than her Grace Under Fire days. She only earned the minimum salary for Hollywood, around $5,000 for a one-day shoot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th colspan=2 scope=col><p>Brett Butler's Personal Information via People</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Full Name</strong></p></td><td><p>Brett Anderson</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Birthdate</strong></p></td><td><p>January 30, 1958</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Birthplace</strong></p></td><td><p>Montgomery, Alabama US</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=1 rowspan=2><p><strong>Parents</strong></p></td><td><p>Roland Decatur Anderson Jr.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Carol</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Number of Siblings</strong></p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=1 rowspan=2><p><strong>Previous Marriages</strong></p></td><td><p>Charles Michael Wilson (1978 - 1981)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ken Zieger (1987 - 1999)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>According to MovieWeb, in July 2021, Brett Butler and her friend, Lon Strickler, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created a GoFundMe account to prevent Butler from being evicted</a> from her Los Angeles apartment.
