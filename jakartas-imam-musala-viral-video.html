MMA, who had only been renting in the Batu Ampar area for about a month, then took out a kitchen knife from his pants pocket and attempted to stab the imam. Fortunately, Lazuardy managed to dodge the attack and subdue MMA. “I only sustained minor injuries, nothing serious. I managed to evade the attack and fell off my motorcycle. I shouted for help, and the locals immediately came to my aid. They apprehended the perpetrator here at the mosque,” Lazuardy explained.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Imams_Account_of_the_Incident></span>Imam’s Account of the Incident<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/asset-2.tstatic.net/tribunnews/foto/bank/images/imam-musala-di-jakarta-timur-nyaris-jadi-korban-penusukan-seorang-pria.jpg alt="Viral Video Imam Musala di Jakarta Timur Jadi Korban Penusukan, Sempat Mengelak hingga Jatuh - TribunNews.com" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>According to Lazuardy, the perpetrator claimed that he was disturbed by the sound of the mosque’s speaker.

Kramat Jati Police Chief, Kompol Rusit Malaka, stated that during preliminary questioning, MMA admitted to carrying out the attack due to being disturbed by the mosque’s speaker. He explained that MMA lived in close proximity to the mosque and decided to take a kitchen knife with him to confront the imam.

MMA, who resided in close proximity to the mosque, expressed his frustration with the noise emanating from the speaker. While it is understandable that excessive noise can be bothersome, it is essential to address such concerns through peaceful means and open dialogue. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a harmonious environment within religious institutions, where the needs and comfort of all worshippers are taken into consideration.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Legal_Consequences_for_the_Attacker></span>Legal Consequences for the Attacker<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The attacker, MMA, now faces severe legal consequences for his actions.
