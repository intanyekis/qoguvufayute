Some of these allegedly unnatural events could have simple, non-evil, explanations or have been grossly over-exaggerated. Other supposed horror movie curses have been exposed as mere publicity stunts.

While claims of Spielberg’s gruesome cost-cutting tactic are unsubstantiated, it seems to be the only explanation for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the unprecedented death of four cast members</a>. The most untimely deaths were of the actors behind the Freeling daughters. In 1982 Dominique Dunne was murdered in her driveway by her ex-boyfriend. In 1988, Heather O'Rourke passed away during an operation at a children’s hospital due to a previously misdiagnosed congenital intestinal abnormality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rosemary-rsquo-s-baby-1968><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rosemary’s Baby (1968)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Rosemarys-Baby.jpg><p>Rosemary’s Baby is considered “the most cursed hit movie ever made,” according to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Vanity Fair</a>. The film seemed to haunt or corrupt its creators. Some faced serious backlash for their involvement in the film, resulting in mental anguish as well as personal and professional hardship. Others faced tragedy following the film’s release. Director Roman Polanski’s pregnant wife Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson Family—a night which later inspired Quentin Tarantino’s film,<a href=#> Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a>.

One of the movie’s actors committed a murder as the film was still being shot, and has been linked to others.

The countless bizarre tragedies and near misses that the film’s creators experienced would suggest that Munger’s warning was warranted. On three separate occasions, lighting struck a plane carrying cast and crew members. A producer was also nearly struck by lighting while filming. In one of the most miraculous tragedies, a jet that was supposed to be carrying the lead actor to a shoot hit a flock of birds and crashed directly into a car. Stranger, the car was occupied by the pilot’s family.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 Movie & TV Show Productions That Were Famously Cursed</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqKqipL9uuc6voJ6rXafCrrvRnptmrJ9ir6Z5wq6prJ2UZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./explosion-kills-fans-ariana-grande-concert-uk-manchester-513396.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ariana Grande Concert Explosion Kills Fans In Manchester</a>
