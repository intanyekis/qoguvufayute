"Tom called me. I said yes immediately," said <a href=#>the Batman Forever star</a>. Director Joseph Kosinski also told Entertainment Weekly that they wanted Iceman to be an "authentic" part of the new movie. "You had to figure out a way to bring Iceman in," he explained. "We met with Val. He had the idea of how to integrate Iceman in a really authentic way." However, they faced some challenges working around Kilmer's inability to speak. "Obviously [we] spent a lot of time on that scene, writing it, getting ready," Kosinski said of having character communicate via written word like the actor in real life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I wasn't sure how it was going to work. … It's a really beautiful scene," the filmmaker continued. "We shot it in Los Angeles in a really beautiful house up on a park. Very special to see not only Val and Tom, but Maverick and Iceman back on the screen together." Kilmer echoed the same sentiments. "We blew a lot of takes laughing so much. It was really fun … special," he raved, adding that "it was like no time had passed at all" when they started filming. "We were all so young during the making of the first movie, but even then there was a special bond between us all," the actor shared. "Even after shooting we would laugh and dance the night away!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Despite A Major Crush, Princess Diana Changed Her Mind About Dating Tom Cruise For One Reason</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-was-val-kilmer-paid-for-39-top-gun-maverick-39>How Much Was Val Kilmer Paid For 'Top Gun: Maverick'?</h2><p>Kilmer's salary for Maverick hasn't really been confirmed by a reliable source. But according to showbizgalore.com, <a href=#>he was paid $400,000</a> while glamourfame.com says he made $2 million in the film. Some reports also cited the actor's <a href=#>initial lack of interest</a> and eventual "begging" for the role as factors in those figures. In his 2020 memoir, I'm Your Huckleberry, Kilmer admitted that he pleaded to be part of the sequel. "As the Temptations sang in the heyday of Motown soul, 'ain't too proud to beg.' The producers went for it and Cruise went for it,'" he wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Heat star was so determined to do Maverick that he immediately called his agent after hearing about its possibility. "I called the agent immediately. Yes, Top Gun has all the perfect elements for a sequel," he shared. He was also involved in creating Iceman's story. Kosinski said that he came up with the idea of his character serving as the high-ranking mentor which was also approved by Cruise. "It is nice to see Iceman reach such success in the career he loved," Kilmer said of Iceman's admiral status. "It's a good story arc. And it was very exciting to be back at it with Tom."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Miles Teller’s ‘The Offer’ Worth Watching?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-39-s-val-kilmer-39-s-health-these-days>How's Val Kilmer's Health These Days?</h2><p>The Doors actor worried a lot of fans when he announced that <a href=#>he could no longer speak</a> due to throat cancer. In his documentary, Val, fans got to see his journey into Hollywood, why <a href=#>he earned the reputation of being difficult to work with</a>, and how he continues to fight cancer. "I obviously am sounding much worse than I feel," the actor expressed in the film. "I can't speak without plugging this hole [in his throat]. You have to make the choice to breathe or to eat. It's an obstacle that is very present with whoever sees me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, he said he's hoping to continue acting despite his condition. "I have behaved bizarrely to some," he said of his reputation. "I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. I am blessed." Recently, Kilmer told USA TODAY via email that he was "moved" to see the new Top Gun film. "I was very moved the first time I saw it. Almost 40 years is a long time for a reunion," he wrote. "We laughed all day. Tom is great and surprisingly funny!!" When asked if he's planning to do more films, he said: "I'm feeling strong and excited to play any chance I get."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Tom Cruise Told Jennifer Connelly They Needed To Reshoot A Scene In Top Gun: Maverick Because It Wasn't Dangerous Enough</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsOiuIykoKWllad6s7HApaOyZZaasq2%2FjJqZqK2kYrOquMyipaBlpKS9brPUp2Smmaaav6qvymg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./john-legend-siblings.html>&#171;&nbsp;John Legend Siblings: A Family United by Music</a>
