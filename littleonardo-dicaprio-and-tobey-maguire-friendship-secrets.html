Whether the friendships started before they became famous or after, it is always great to see two celebs enjoying each other's company. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire are celebs BFFs who are iconic as a duo. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leo is a private person</a>, but we appreciate it when he is seen with his friends or his lovely girlfriend, Camila Morrone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tobey's career isn't at hot as it once was</a>, but he may have more opportunities in the future. The fact that he and Leo have similar backgrounds and a long-lasting friendship means that they are always linked together. Their friendship is famous, just like their acting and philanthropy.</p><p>Here are some little-known facts about Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire's friendship.</p><h2 id=a-long-lasting-friendship><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>A Long-Lasting Friendship</span></h2><p>To show you how close Leo and Tobey are, they have been friends with each other for over 30 years. In light of how much they have in common, these two are just the perfect definition of two peas in a pod. Can you name another duo who have been friends for most of their lives?</p><h2 id=both-have-similar-backgrounds><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Both Have Similar Backgrounds</span></h2><p>Leo and Tobey came from similar backgrounds. Both of them were raised by their single mothers in Los Angeles and both got into acting when they were 12.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering that these two were in similar living situations, we aren't surprised at all that they became friends. We are honestly glad, as they have one of the best friendships in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=appreciators-of-japanese-animation><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Appreciators Of Japanese Animation</span></h2><p>It has not been discussed much, but Tobey and Leo are huge fans of anime, also known as Japanese animation. Leo wants to adapt the 1988 film,&nbsp;Akira, as a live-action film, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tobey is a possible producer</a>&nbsp;of a live-action remake of&nbsp;Robotech. Both projects are not set in stone, but with Leo and Tobey's dedication and appreciation for anime, they might turn into faithful adaptations on the big screen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Actors Who Didn’t Want To Kiss Their Co-Star…For Good Reason</a></span></p><h2 id=joined-a-posse><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Joined A Posse</span></h2><p>In their younger years, Leo and Tobey were just like any other rebellious guys. They were associated with a group known as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">P*ssy Posse</a>, which formed in the late 90s, immediately after Leo starred in the juggernaut film,&nbsp;Titanic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were many others in the group, including&nbsp;Josh Miller,&nbsp;Jay Ferguson, Ethan Suplee, and Kevin Connolly, who later appeared in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the show, Entourage</a>. The gang partied hard and enjoyed adult shows whenever possible. The posse eventually disbanded due to being reckless around other people, but they still remain friends to this day.</p><h2 id=pals-with-advice><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Pals With Advice</span></h2><p>Whether it has to do with film projects, personal issues, or anything else, Leo and Tobey rely on each other for advice. Sometimes, they disagree about topics or ideas for projects, but that's how friendships work every now and then. They've been talking for three decades.</p><h2 id=starred-in-a-very-rare-film><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Starred In A Very Rare Film</span></h2><p>While the posse that Leo and Tobey were part of did get wild and rebellious, it eventually brought them (and others) together to make a low-budget movie. Titled Don's Plum, it was never got an official release in North America.</p><p>Instead, it was released at the Berlin International Film Festival, and in Denmark in 2001. However, thanks to the power of the Internet, the full movie can be seen on YouTube, rather than being 'lost media'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio’s Greatest Film Roles, Officially Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=saving-the-world-together><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Saving The World Together</span></h2><p>As Leo got older, he went from a party animal to a renowned environmentalist. He would host galas, hoping to raise awareness about damaged ecosystems and environments. He also worked to protect wildlife. While Tobey is not on Leo's level in terms of activism, he is there as a guest at many of Leo's events. When they aren't helping, they like to hang out on yachts.</p><h2 id=only-worked-on-three-films-together><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Only Worked On Three Films Together</span></h2><p>Despite being the best of friends for over 30 years, they have only worked on a total of three films together throughout their careers. The first one they did is called This Boy's Life, which was based on a memoir written by Tobias Wolff.</p><p>As previously mentioned, they worked on a rare film with their posse,&nbsp;Don's Plum. Their recent, and most iconic, work together is 2013's&nbsp;The Great Gatsby. There are currently no plans for them to collaborate on another film together, but you never know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=uncle-leo><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Uncle Leo</span></h2><p>If there is one thing that Tobey managed to do before Leo, it is to get married and have children of his own. Leo technically has an adopted daughter, but aside from that, he has no biological children. However, Leo has the wonderful opportunity to be an unofficial uncle to Tobey's son and daughter. Leo is adorable around kids.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Hide From The Paparazzi When Driving (10 Who Want The Attention)</a></span></p><h2 id=not-only-buddies-but-also-neighbors><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Not Only Buddies But Also Neighbors</span></h2><p>Their friendship doesn't stop with enduring for most of their lives. When they were younger, Leo and Tobey used to live next door to each other, around&nbsp;The Bird Streets in L.A. as reported by&nbsp;Sheltr Group.</p><p>The actors revealed this while working on The Great Gatsby. They were so close that it would take about 30 seconds to get from one home to the other. To live by your closest friend is definitely friendship goals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=competitions-never-severed-their-bond><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Competitions Never Severed Their Bond</span></h2><p>Friendships can be ruined when two or more people get competitive at a game or at scoring a date with the same person. Thankfully, in Leo and Tobey's case, they never let Hollywood competition interfere with their bond.</p><p>Leo is definitely more successful in landing roles than Tobey and always has been. Leo's gotten parts that Tobey tried to get, such as the leading part in&nbsp;This Boy's Life. Even if one is more successful than the other, they value their friendship.</p><h2 id=their-first-interaction><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Their First Interaction</span></h2><p>How did the longtime friendship between Leo and Tobey start? It was Leo who encountered and recognized Tobey while filming a TV show. According to Esquire, Leo told his mother to stop the car...and he actually jumped out of the vehicle. He shouted, "Tobey!" a couple of times. It began there.</p><p>Tobey also told Esquire about this fateful encounter. While Leo was very enthusiastic about seeing him, Tobey had a different reaction, saying, "Oh, yeah — I know you. You're... that guy." He did make him his friend and the rest is history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Most Celebs Praise Leonardo DiCaprio, But Some Think He’s Overrated</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqykobKwusCrm6hllJ6worzRoqZmmZ6ZerW7wZ6wZqWRnMKqvsRmnauhlaOxtLTIqWSsnZOnsrW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./russell-crowe.html>&#171;&nbsp;Russell Crowe</a>
