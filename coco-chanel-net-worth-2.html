She had a challenging childhood, with her parents working in menial jobs to make ends meet. Tragically, Chanel’s mother passed away when she was just 11 years old, leaving her and her siblings in a vulnerable position.</p><p>Due to their circumstances, Chanel and her siblings were sent to an orphanage, where she learned important skills that would later shape her career. It was during her time at the orphanage that Chanel developed a passion for sewing. Her skills flourished, and she quickly became adept at creating clothing and accessories.</p><p>After leaving the orphanage, Chanel lived in a boarding house for Catholic girls. It was here that she began her career as a seamstress, honing her craft and gaining invaluable experience in the world of fashion.</p><h2>Chanel Founding</h2><p>Coco Chanel embarked on her journey as a fashion designer by venturing into hat design while residing with her lover, Étienne Balsan. Her talent and creativity caught the attention of the theatre world when renowned actress Gabrielle Dorziat showcased Chanel’s hats in a play, propelling Chanel into the spotlight.</p><p>In 1910, Chanel further solidified her position in the fashion industry by becoming a licensed milliner. She established her boutique, <b>Chanel Modes</b>, in the fashion capital of Paris, thereby laying the foundation for her eponymous fashion brand that would revolutionize women’s fashion.</p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Milestone</th></tr><tr><td>1910</td><td>Chanel becomes a licensed milliner and opens <b>Chanel Modes</b> boutique in Paris</td></tr><tr><td>1913</td><td>Chanel expands her business with a boutique in Deauville</td></tr><tr><td>1915</td><td>Chanel opens another successful location in Biarritz</td></tr></table><p>Chanel’s boutique in Paris became a hub for fashion-forward individuals seeking unique and stylish designs.
