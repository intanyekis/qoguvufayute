It appeared the mother-of-four had&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other plans in mind</a> after having reportedly made millions from publicizing her romance with Kris from beginning to end.</p><p class=p1>When Kris proposed to Kim in May 2011, fans were able to watch the moment it happened on the family’s reality show, ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians,’ only to find out later on that the proposal scene was reshot because the camera crew wasn’t there when Humphries first popped the question.</p><p class=p1>But because we know the Kardashians are all about keeping the ratings, a camera team was called over to Kim’s Beverly Hills mansion so that she could reenact her initial reaction to finding out Kris had popped the question. But what else is there to know about this former couple’s relationship that appears to have gone under the radar?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-dated-after-kim-s-split-with-gabriel-aubry><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They Dated After Kim's Split With Gabriel Aubry</span></h2><p>Most fans don’t remember that Kim Kardashian was seeing Halle Berry’s ex, Gabriel Aubry, before she got with NBA star, Kris Humphries. Her romance with the model only lasted a couple of months before they agreed to call it quits. The KKW founder started filming ‘Kourtney & Kim Take New York,’ where she would later be&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced to Kris</a>&nbsp;around November 2010.</p><h2 id=they-went-public-at-a-prince-concert><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Went Public At A Prince Concert</span></h2><p>Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries didn’t go public with their relationship until February 2011 when they were seen hand-in-hand at a Prince concert in Manhattan. The reality TV star was all smiles as she posed for photographs with her new man by her side, who would later star in 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians.'</p><h2 id=he-proposed-in-may-2011><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Proposed In May 2011</span></h2><p>Just three months after Kim and Kris were seen together in public for the first time, it was reported that the athlete had gotten on one knee and proposed at Kim’s Beverly Hills home.

Well, that was one of many retakes for the family’s reality show, ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians,’ because the camera crew <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn’t there to film</a> the big moment when it first happened. So, of course, they had to recreate the moment when Kim got engaged, all for the sake of our entertainment... and ratings, of course.</p><h2 id=they-were-only-engaged-for-three-months><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Were Only Engaged For Three Months</span></h2><p>After another three months, Kim Kardashian walked down the aisle and married the man she vowed to love for the rest of her life, which was obviously a lie given how fast the marriage ended, but it was a special moment for Kim nonetheless. After all, she earned a substantial amount from the star-studded event held at an estate in Montecito, California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-landed-a-lucrative-wedding-special-on-e><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Landed A Lucrative Wedding Special On E!</span></h2><p>Aside from reportedly earning $1.5 million for selling their exclusive&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding photos</a> to People magazine, Kim Kardashian and her mother, Kris Jenner, negotiated a lucrative deal for E!
