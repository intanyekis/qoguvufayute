has been falling even more in love with her husband, <a href=#><strong>Swizz Beatz</strong></a>, with every decade, but she didn’t instantly connect with her partner.</p><p>Keys first crossed paths with Beatz (real name Kasseem Daoud Dean) in the ‘90s when they were both teenagers living in New York. “We talked for a minute about nothing deep, and then as I walked off, he asked if we could exchange numbers,” Keys revealed in her 2020 memoir, More Myself. “I was like, ‘Nah, I’m good. I’ll just see you when I see you.'”</p><p>By the mid-2000s, the pair had begun working on music together before connecting romantically, and in 2010, they got married. Keys and Beatz have since welcomed two sons and learned each other’s rhythm.</p><p>“We understand each other and we communicate,” Beatz <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in June 2019 of the couple’s secret to a happy marriage. “We’re just the f–king best.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Keys and Beatz’s relationship from the beginning:</p><h3><strong>Mid-1990s</strong></h3><p>Keys revealed in her 2020 memoir, More Myself, that she met Beatz when she was 14 and he was 16.
