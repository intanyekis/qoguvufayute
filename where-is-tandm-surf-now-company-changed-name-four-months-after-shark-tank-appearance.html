The program gives them the opportunity to at least receive some exposure by asking them to present their business ideas and plans to a group of business professionals we know as Sharks. If the prospective entrepreneurs' ideas appeal to the <a href=# rel>Sharks</a>, they propose to engage in their business in return for shares. <a href=# rel>Tandem Boogie,</a> as seen in Season 12, aimed to accomplish this.</p><p>So let us give you an update on the business before we learn more about it in the forthcoming 'Shark Tank' episode. Continue reading to find out more.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Shark Tank': Why does Tandem Boogie bodyboard cost $459? Clarks justify price as viewers say it's 'expensive'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Where is Foam Party Hats now? Mother-son entrepreneurial duo pulls millions in sales after 'Shark Tank'</a></p><h2 class=split>What happened during their time on 'Shark Tank'?</h2><p>The Clark family made an appearance on 'Shark Tank' in Season 12, Episode 17, with Tandem Surf, a bodyboard designed for two people. They hoped to persuade the Sharks to give them a $100,000 investment in exchange for a 10% ownership stake in their business. As a result of selling $43,000 worth of their merchandise in the first two months of operation, they had a wealth of favorable financial data to support their business strategy. And their product, which costs $150 to produce but brought in $459, made a tidy profit.</p><p>The Clarks asked guest Shark Daniel Lubetzky if he wanted to participate after all the Sharks except for Robert Herjavec declined. Daniel entered and proposed a 25% split between the two of them. "25% isn't enough," Robert remarked while shaking his head. "And I'm just being completely sincere. It is a lot of work, and it's going to take a lot of time." The Clarks attempted to haggle Robert's equity down to 30%, but he didn't budge, so they settled on 35%. "Robert and Daniel are perfect for our family," said Manya Clark, who was pleased with the bid. "They're both immigrants. They came to this country as young kids, just like I did, and made the American dream come true." The Clark family has been working hard to boost both their visibility and their offerings in the year since they were featured on the program.</p><h2 class=split>Where is TANDM Surf now and how is the company faring?</h2><p>The Clarks altered the name of their company after appearing on 'Shark Tank,' informing <a href=# rel>meaww.com</a> that they would "be changing our name from Tandem Boogie to TANDM Surf, as we are about more than just bodyboarding." And so it has been. For the summer of 2022, they launched two new products: a tandem surfboard and a stand-up paddleboard and kayak for two people.</p><p>The only place TANDM Surf had to offer their boards was online at the time they appeared on the program. They have developed their web profile since appearing on 'Shark Tank', and the boards are now offered in Surf Style shops. They've also teamed up with Indo Jax, a nonprofit organization that teaches surfing to children with special needs, and Epic Summer Surf and Beach Camp to bring their boards to children's surf programs.</p><p>As TANDM Surf has grown and expanded since its appearance on 'Shark Tank', the company's future appears to be promising. Both Daniel Lubetzky and Robert Herjavec are still actively engaged in promoting the company by giving it shout-outs on their social media accounts.</p><p>'Shark Tank' Season 14 Episode 16 features an update segment on the business.</p><p>'Shark Tank' Season 14, Episode 16 airs on ABC on Friday, March 10, 2023, at 8 pm ET.
