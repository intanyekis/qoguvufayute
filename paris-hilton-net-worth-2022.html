Without her, juicy sweatsuits would not be the same, and you are aware of this.</p><p>The 41-year-old heiress to the Hilton hotels has never shied away from flaunting her opulent way of life. Cooking With Paris, her most recent project, offers viewers a closer look at her close-knit family and friends.</p><p>Despite having a well-known last name, the majority of her money (and numerous pairs of shoes and sunglasses) come from her own businesses. That’s hot, as the heiress would say.</p><p>So how exactly does she make money?</p><h2>Everything you need to know about Paris Hilton’s net worth and the countless side businesses that enabled her to achieve it is provided below:</h2><p>Despite being an heiress, Paris didn’t stand to inherit a sizable wealth.</p><p><strong>According to Reuters, the Hilton fortune is enormous and amounts to over $4.5 billion.</strong> But Barron Hilton, <strong>Paris’ grandfather, declared in 2004 that he would give 97% of his wealth to charity.</strong></p><p>Barron gave 3% of his estate to his eight grandchildren, his fifteen grandchildren, and his four great-grandchildren when he passed away in 2019, according to Insider. <strong>In total, the 3% amounted to over $135 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</strong> But that’s no tiny amount. <strong>Paris would receive $5.6 million, divided equally.</strong> Barron requested that the remaining funds be given to the Conrad N. Hilton foundation.</p><p>There were even whispers that Paris had been completely left out of her grandfather’s bequest. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he wasn’t exactly a fan of Paris’ numerous scandals and believed she was a disgrace to the Hilton family name.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton)</a></p><p>In any case, everything appears to have transpired as Paris had hoped: “I’ve wanted to be independent ever since I was a youngster. I didn’t want to need anything from my family, “she spoke with Refinery 29 in 2018.</p><p>“Even my grandfather told me, “I used to be known as Barron Hilton,” despite the fact that I did originate from Hilton hotels. I’m now referred to as Grandpa Hilton.”</p><h2>Her modeling career began in the late 1990s.</h2><p>Paris joined Donald Trump’s agency, T Management, in 2000 after working as a child model and then breaking into the New York City scene as a socialite in her teens. According to Insider, she participated in New York <a href=#>Fashion Week</a> presentations for many designers and established a respectable modeling career.</p><p>Paris went on to walk the catwalk for companies like Guess and Christian Dior, and she periodically returns to her roots. In 2018, she walked the runway for <a href=#>Kanye West</a>‘s Yeezy 6 Collection. Her early modeling jobs undoubtedly contributed to the growth of her financial account.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton)</a></p><h2>From her s*x video scandal, Paris received some money in court.</h2><p>Paris’ court battle was protracted and widely publicized after her s*x tape was made public in 2003. “Simply put, that was the most agonizing experience. It definitely made me lose hope in romantic love and confidence in men. And it just truly hurts my heart to think that I’ll be judged for the rest of my life based on a secret exchange between two people that no one was ever allowed to see “in recent days, according to Mirror.</p><p>According to Insider,<strong> Paris ended up with about $400,000 when everything was said and done.</strong></p><h2>The Simple Life featured Paris for four years.</h2><p><strong>The Simple Life, Paris’ first television program, ran from 2003 until 2007.</strong> The Fox reality show followed Paris and her best friend, fellow socialite Nicole Richie, as they tried to make their way through a set that was considerably different from their home.</p><p>Paris’ early reign as the queen of reality TV was solidified by the show’s high ratings. According to a 2005 source, Paris earned $5 million for acting in just one season of the program. According to People, Nicole was supposedly offered significantly less than that.</p><p>This information was pulled from a poll. On their website, you might be able to discover the same material in a different format or more details.</p><p>Paris went on to appear in a few other less popular reality shows after The Simple Life. The World According to Paris and most of her other programs were only on television for one or two seasons. It is unknown how much she was paid for these roles, but considering that <strong>Paris received a cool $300,000 in 2013 for a four-episode guest appearance on a Danish version of the show Paradise Hotel,</strong> it is probable that her TV career earned her a respectable sum, according to Radar.</p><h2>Paris released her debut novel in 2004.</h2><p></p><p>Upon its release in 2004, Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Cheek Peek Behind the Pose quickly became a New York Times bestseller. Your Heiress Diary: Confess It All To Me, Paris’ second book, was released just one year later.</p><p>The list price of her publications ranges from $11 to $36. Since they have been in print for about 15 years, Paris has probably made a sizable fortune from her brief career as a novelist.</p><h2>The same year, Paris also started selling perfumes.</h2><p>Paris’ empire of fragrances accounts for a sizable portion of her net fortune. What an empire it is as well. According to Money, she has so far purchased 24 perfumes.</p><p>Parisian perfumes are said to have generated a staggering $3 billion in sales since 2004. Only Elizabeth Taylor’s line of celebrity perfumes has enjoyed greater success than hers.</p><p>She told Money that she takes great pride in her line of perfumes: “I needed more than one! We must satisfy the needs of the fans because they want more. One day, I might have 100 “She spoke.</p><h2>Paris continued to use her catchphrases to make some money.</h2><p>Paris profited from her well-known catchphrases from The Simple Life, such as “that’s hot” and “living” (a mix of “slaying” and “living”). She filed a lawsuit against Hallmark in 2007 when the greeting card maker put “that’s hot” next to her photo. Three years later, the case was resolved in Paris’ favor for an unknown (substantial) sum, according to CNBC.</p><h2>Paris’ debut album, Paris, helped her soar up the charts in 2006.</h2><p>Paris released her debut album, Paris, in 2006 after founding her own label, Heiress Records. The album reached No. 6 on the Billboard 200 and sold 200,000 copies. According to Billboard, her song “Stars Are Blind” peaked at No. 18 on the Hot 100.</p><p>Paris has released nine additional promotional singles since then, but she hasn’t yet released another album. Although it’s unclear how much money Paris has made from her pop star career, the number of copies sold suggests a sizable income.</p><p></p><h2>Then Paris changed directions and became a DJ, earning millions.</h2><p>Following successful pop albums, TV appearances, and book deals, Paris tried out the DJ scene. According to Billboard, Paris made her DJ debut at a pop music festival in Brazil in 2012.</p><p>She received honors for her performances, agreed to a residency at Harrah’s in Atlantic City in 2014, and later that year, she started a 13-show tour.</p><p>According to The Guardian, she was the highest-paid DJ in the world in 2015, earning more than $1 million per performance.</p><h2>Additionally, she profits handsomely from brand arrangements.</h2><p><strong>According to The Daily Mail, Paris generates about $10 million annually from her 19 product lines</strong>. According to Bloomberg, her name is on 50 retail locations around the world as well as real estate, vitamins, and flowers.</p><p>She has also appeared in a lot of commercials, including her well-known Carl’s Jr. commercials from that year. And in her most recent appearance, she sat on an inflatable couch in the midst of a swamp with Steve Irwin’s kids for an Uber Eats commercial, which undoubtedly earned a lot of money.</p><p>But when it comes to commercial partners, Paris is quite picky. According to her manager, she declines anywhere between 12 and 20 corporate deals each day, according to The Guardian. Of course, the deals she does take also add to her financial cushion.</p><p></p><h2>She has accumulated acting credits throughout the years in both films and TV shows.</h2><p>Paris switched from reality television to a variety of written roles. Although there are little specifics about her acting income, she has starred in movies like House of Wax and played supporting roles in others like Zoolander and The Cat in the Hat.</p><p>In terms of television, Paris appeared as a guest star on several episodes of popular series including Veronica Mars, The O.C., and Supernatural.</p><p><strong>You can now pay Paris to attend your party in exchange for money.</strong></p><p>When Paris isn’t modeling, DJing, or managing her numerous businesses, she collects “appearance fees” to attend events. She will show up at your party for $300,000, but according to the Daily Mail, she will probably leave in less than two hours.</p><h2>Cookery With Paris, her brand-new cooking programme, debuted on Netflix in 2021.</h2><p>On her television programme, Cooking With Paris, which she chose to launch after a YouTube video of her in the kitchen garnered 5 million views, Paris serves as executive producer. Kim Kardashian and Nikki Glaser were among the many famous guests that appeared on her show, which quickly gained popularity on the streaming platform.</p><p>Paris told Delish, “It’s definitely not your typical food show.” I’m learning a lot in the kitchen on the job because I’m not a trained or professional chef.</p><p>Cooking With Paris has some expensive maintenance needs. You might notice if you watch the show that Paris doesn’t wear an apron and wears fashionable clothing, which cost $2,000 to have dry-cleaned, according to Mashed. There is currently no information about the addition to her funds, though.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton)</a></p><h2>In Paris in Love, Paris was starring with her husband.</h2><p>According to Delish, the wedding show, which debuted in November 2021, followed Paris and her then-fiance, Carter Reum, as they prepared for their special day. “He’s unlike anyone I’ve ever met before and the first person I’ve allowed into my heart who I entirely trust. He is my staunchest ally and constantly cheers me on and gives me a sense of security “said Paris.</p><p>I’m now more concerned about infants than billions, she continued. There have been no further developments on the likelihood of a second season since the season finale aired in early 2022.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton)</a></p><h2>So, how much money is Paris Hilton worth?</h2><p>According to Celebrity <a href=#>Net Worth</a>, Paris has a total<a href=#> net worth</a> of almost $300 million from all of her side businesses.
