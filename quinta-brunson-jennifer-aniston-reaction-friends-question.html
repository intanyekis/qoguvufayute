"Oh God, don't make me cry," said the former who could barely hold her tears back. The latter responded, "I won't... We won't make each other cry," to which the We're the Millers alum said, "Okay." <strong>But then Aniston started crying, so Brunson offered to take a break</strong>. "You're already crying," she said. "Do you want a minute?

(likely referring to Perry). Brunson immediately said, "I know, yeah. Are you sure we don't have to...." Aniston said she was "okay" and "it's a happy tears" before wiping her tears and saying, "And we're back." They then joked about Friends being as old as the Rumor Has It star. Brunson said, "So Friends is turning 30," to which Aniston added, "And I'm turning 30." She then shared a premiere memory including Perry and <strong><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a></strong>.</p><p>"It's so strange to even think that it's 30 years old, 'cause actually, I remember the day that it was going to premiere, you know on television on NBC."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turned out, the day of the premiere, Aniston and Perry played a messy prank on Kudrow during her hair appointment. "Me and Matthew Perry were having lunch somewhere, and we knew Lisa was getting her hair colored," she recalled. "So we ran into the hair salon and I snuck up and she was in the sink the hair bowl and I took the nozzle and just started like washing her hair from the guy that was supposed to be doing it."</p><p><strong>That was how "excited" they were back then</strong>. "And it definitely flew out of control and that. And that was unfortunate, but the excitement we had," Aniston continued. "And it feels like yesterday, that day... So <strong>the fact that</strong><strong>[Friends] has had this long wonderful life and it's still... means a lot to people is one of the greatest gifts I think all five of us, all six of us ever – we never could imagine</strong>." She went on to call her co-stars <strong>"family forever"</strong>.</p><p>The Friends cast was the first group to negotiate an equal individual salary of $100,000 per episode in 1997 (season 4). They were each paid $22,000 per episode in season 1.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jennifer-aniston-and-adam-sandler-s-history-started-long-before-their-hollywood-fame.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Problem Jennifer Aniston Has Standing Near Adam Sandler On Red Carpets">The Problem Jennifer Aniston Has Standing Near Adam Sandler On Red Carpets</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler's friendship spans across decades, but she has one problem with appearing with him on red carpets.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-spoke-to-matthew-perry-the-most-among-the-39-friends-39-cast-during-his-battle-with-addiction>Jennifer Aniston Spoke To Matthew Perry The Most Among The 'Friends' Cast During His Battle With Addiction</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/friends-cast-at-the-friends-reunion.jpg><p>In 2004, Aniston notably <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">broke down in tears while talking to Diane Sawyer</a> about Perry's battle with addiction.
