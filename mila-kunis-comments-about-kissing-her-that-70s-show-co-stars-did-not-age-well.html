Mila Kunis was fresh into her career and on the verge of becoming a star. Instead of celebrating that fact, she was asked about kissing several of her That '70s Show co-stars. At that point, Topher Grace was the only cast member she didn't kiss. Given what came to light with Danny Masterson, her response was that much more alarming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She said, "I kissed the Mastersons, I've kissed everybody.

I was 19. And they were like, ‘You guys are going to be making out in this scene.’ And I’m thinking, ‘Wait, this is slightly illegal.'”</p><p>Kunis adds, “I was a 14-year-old little girl and I was extremely scared for my life. He was very nice about it, like, ‘Don’t worry about it.’ Then Danny goes to him and goes, ‘Dude, I’ll give you $10 if you French kiss her.'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/your-paragraph-text-2024-01-30t085934-345.png><p>The bet was also confirmed by Kutcher himself.</p><p>“We had a little side bet going,” Kutcher confirms. “You’re kissing on the show, we’re boyfriend and girlfriend.

So, to go back and have it be this new shared experience was really wild and nostalgic. There’s so many memories that come alive, like when you see the basement again or these characters that were so much a part of our life for such a long time. It was just so nostalgic for us. I’m excited for these kids that are hopefully going to experience the same ride we got to go on when we were their age."</p><p>He continued, "Any day I get to go to work with my wife is the best day of the year. I think the crazy thing about that experience is we are in a completely different place in our relationship now than where we were then."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without a doubt, fans would be open to seeing the two reunite once again on That '90s Show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikoqSRYri2usisZJynnaKyr8DSZpibp6Wpeqy10qygp59dnbKzedOhmK1lZ2XAbr%2FHqK5mm59iwLWt0axknaGUYruwwIyanp5lp5q5rXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ruby-franke-mug-shot-wikipedia-age-and-boyfriend.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ruby Franke Mug Shot Wikipedia, Age And Boyfriend</a>
