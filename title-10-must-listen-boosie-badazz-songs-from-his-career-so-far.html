Before the nearly five year prison stay and name change from Lil Boosie, the Baton Rouge, Louisiana emcee was on his way to becoming a major force in Hip Hop. Though many’s first introduction to Boosie Boo was the <a href=#>Young Joc</a> featured “Zoom” and his scene stealing verse on Foxx’s “Whip Me Down,” his time in the game actually is around fifteen years old. Going back to the beginning of his career, Boosie Boo started as a member of the C-Loc led Concentration Camp. One of the earliest known collectives in Baton Rouge’s then emerging rap scene, Torrence Hatch eventually dropped the hood classic <i>Youngest Of The Camp</i> at the mere age of seventeen.</p><p>Years later, Boosie made his way over to the <a href=#>Pimp C</a> backed <a href=#>Trill Entertainment</a>. This is where mainstream Hip Hop started to notice, most notably&nbsp;after <i>For My Thugz </i>along with both the collaborative <i>Ghetto Stories </i>and <i>Gangsta Musik </i>projects with <a href=#>Webbie</a>. By the time his major label debut <i>Bad Azz</i> hit shelves, he managed to make history as the first inductee into XXL’s first Freshmen Class. &nbsp;When it looked like Boosie was making his way to a new rap plateau, he would find himself dealing with drug charges, probation violation and even a murder conviction. Back with a vengeance, Boosie has much to prove.</p><p>If this week’s release of <i>Touchdown 2 Cause Hell </i>has anything to say, he’s doubling down on all his promises. &nbsp;With that in mind, DX takes a look back into some of Boosie Badazz’s best tracks so far.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2><b>Zoom Featuring Young Joc –&nbsp;“Bad Azz“</b></h2><p><br>For Boosie’s major label introduction, he brought Young Joc along for “Zoom.” Produced by Trill Entertainment in-house producer<a href=#> Mouse On Tha Track</a>, the debut single from Bad Azz worked well enough to make the gain some traction on both Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and Hot Rap charts. Then again, the world can never forget these amusing bars:</p><p>“One name Sara, one name Tina<br>Together they make weather like Katrina<br>They a fool shawty – red, she a rough rider<br>She get on back of that motor bike<br>And all you see is back on that motor bike (WOO)”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2><b>Bucked Up – “For My Thugz”</b></h2><p></p><p>The track was featured on Boosie’s first solo outing on Trill Entertainment <i>For My Thugz. </i>Tru Dawg helped formulate the backing for what’s considered a local classic through “Bucked Up.” Part turn-up, part club narrative, there isn’t a better way to describe his early local hype. Boosie is bucked up and fucked up and ready to represent his hood along with his status in Southern Hip Hop.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2><b>Do It Big With Webbie – “Ghetto Stories”</b></h2><p><br><i>Ghetto Stories</i> would be the first in two collaborative projects between Boosie and Webbie. Track three was further proof relating to how well the two worked well with each other. &nbsp;While the rest of the world worries about flexing to the maximum, Lil Boosie and Webbie essentially gave a practical lesson in appreciating what one has. So what if one has a beat-up Cutless; hit the corner like it’s a brand new Camero. “Do It Big” was aspirational and self-prophecy as Boosie said he’d really show off once he got the major label deal.<strong><strong></strong></strong></p><h2><b>Swerve With Boosie – “Gangsta Musik”</b></h2><p></p><p>Trill ENT introduced one special producer who would serve as the backing soundtrack to the label’s mainstream success for Boosie and Webbie’s second outing together. Mouse On Tha Track produced&nbsp;two of the project’s biggest singles; “Swerve” and “Give Me That.” While the later featuring <a href=#>Bun B</a> would catapult Webbie to mainstream recognition and be featured on his Trill ENT debut <i>Savage Life</i>, “Swerve” made&nbsp;the soundtrack for <i>Hustle & Flow</i>.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2><b>Its Goin Down – “Youngest Of The Camp”</b></h2><p></p><p><i>Youngest Of The Camp</i> was Boosie’s first solo album as part of The Concentration Camp. The level of hunger at hand and street wisdom was articulated well enough to be considered his first classic. There wasn’t a better example than “Its Goin Down.” Giving a look into his life within the poverty and crime ridden area of South Side Baton Rouge, the track also serves as a warning call for those who dare to try him.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2><b>Wipe Me Down With Foxx and Webbie – “Survival Of The Fittest”</b></h2><p></p><p>Originally featured on Foxx’s Trill ENT debut <i>Street Gossip</i>, Boosie stole the show on the following remix with signature opener “B O O S I E B A D A Z Z, that’s me.” The verse was good enough for many to call it Boosie Boo’s song featuring Foxx and Webbie. From that moment on, he officially would become the label’s flagship artist.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2><b>I’m Mad – “Bad Azz“</b></h2><p><br>Not only does Boosie lashes out at his critics but also manages to make some honest social commentary as well on <i>Bad Azz </i>track “I’m Mad.” In one track, he threatens phallic mutilation, anal sex with former teacher’s daughter and questions the decision making skills of former United States president George Bush.</p><h2><b>Independent With Webbie & Lil Phat –&nbsp;“Savage Life 2”</b></h2><p><br>The biggest hit single for Boosie, Webbie and the late<a href=#> Lil Phat</a>, “Independant” represented the quintessential song “for the ladies.” For women who had their own money, bank account, car, job and life without men, the radio hit became their theme song. Of course, Boosie would deliver another scene stealing verse.<strong><strong></strong></strong></p><h2><b>Better Believe It Featuring Webbie & Young Jeezy – “SuperBad: The Return of Boosie Bad Azz”</b></h2><p></p><p>Following the success of the “Wipe Me Down” remix and his debut Bad Azz, Boosie started to attract attention as one of Southern rap’s mainstays. One of the first high profile artists to catch the way was <a href=#>Young Jeezy</a> for “Better Believe It.” Also featuring Webbie, the track would be featured on Mr. Badazz’s sophomore follow-up SuperBad : The Return of Boosie Bad Azz. While the album was seen as a disappointment to some and was the last official release from him before spending several years in prison, this collaboration was a clear highlight.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2><b>Do The Ratchet With Lava House – “Click Clack Connection”&nbsp;</b></h2><p></p><p>Before becoming an overused mainstream term, ratchet was popular local slang in northern Louisiana town Shreveport. Originally a track created by local area Lava House Records, Lil Boosie made a newer version years later that became one of his top five signatures and even came along with a dance. For a dance cut, Boosie’s verse also strangely veers into 9/11 conspiracy territory at one point. If anyone wants to pinpoint the first real commercial usage of the term ratchet, point them in this direction.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong><br><b><i>Ural Garrett is an Los Angeles-based journalist and HipHopDX’s Senior Features Writer.
