Lopez</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Sean “Diddy” Combs</strong></a> were one of the most famous couples on the planet — and since their split, Lopez has shared the rare quote about her ex-boyfriend.</p><p>The duo dated for about twoyears after meeting on the set of a music video in 1999. Throughout their time together, the former couple experienced some major highs and lows in the public eye.</p><p>During the early days of their relationship, Diddy and Lopez were arrested on weapons and bribery charges following a New York City nightclub shooting in December 1999. While the charges against Lopez were dropped, Diddy was acquitted in 2001.</p><p>The duo broke up in February 2001, after infidelity rumors started to swirl. (Lopez has since confirmed that Diddy was unfaithful during their time together.)</p><p>While that was a lowpoint of their relationship, Diddy (then known as Puff Daddy) was also Lopez’s date to the 2000 <a href=#>Grammy Awards</a> where she wore the iconic green Versace dress that is still referenced all these years later.</p><p>Fans are scrutinizing everything in Diddy’s past 4 after the rapper’s houses were <a href=#>raided by Homeland Security</a> in connection with a <a href=#>federal sex trafficking investigation</a>. (Accusations which he’s since denied.)</p><p>“There were people in my life who said ‘I love you’ and then didn’t do things that were kind of in line with the word ‘love.’ Being <a href=#>thrown around and manhandled</a> like that is not fun,” Lopez said in <a href=#>her 2024 documentary</a>, The Greatest Love Story Never Told.</p><p>Without identifying who she was referring to, she added, “I mean, I was never in a relationship where I got beat up, thank God, but I’ve definitely been manhandled and a couple of other unsavory things. Rough. Disrespectful.”</p><p>While they were together — and since they’ve split — Lopez has, however, offered more details about her time with the music mogul. Keep scrolling to read her quotes about Diddy:</p><h3>Reflecting on Her Arrest</h3><p>“It was a complete nightmare from beginning to end,” Lopez recalled to Elle in July 2000. “I was scared to death in the car. I had absolutely no idea what was going on. No one did.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jennifer-Lopez-Has-Spoken-About-Diddy-a-Few-Times-Through-the-Years-1.jpg><h3>Some Major Differences</h3><p>Discussing the differences in their lifestyles, Lopez called herself “a homebody” during a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone.</p><p>“Puff loves to go out,” she said at the time, referring to his former stage name Puff Daddy. “He’s been a going-out-to-clubs person all his life, doing his thing.”</p><h3>Confirming His Infidelity</h3><p>Lopez told Vibe <a href=#>magazine in May 2003</a> that she “never caught him” cheating but “knew” in her gut. “He’d say he was going to a club for a couple of hours and then never come back that night,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jennifer-Lopez-Has-Spoken-About-Diddy-a-Few-Times-Through-the-Years-2.jpg><p>“It was the first time I was with someone who wasn’t faithful,” Lopez added. “I was in this relationship with Puff where I was totally crying, crazy and going nuts, it really took my whole life in a tailspin.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lopez decided to end it for good after wondering, “Do I want to be home with kids in 10 years wondering where somebody is at three in the morning?”</p><h3>Looking Back on the Good Times</h3><p>Despite the hardships in their relationship, Lopez recalled the lessons Diddy taught her while they were together.</p><p>“He gave me so many cues and taught me so many things,” she told Access Hollywood in October 2014. “I’ll always be grateful to him for that, and I love that he can be so supportive of me so many years later and there’s still so much mutual respect, admiration and love there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0WajqKiVr8BuvdSoq56rXZavsMHTZpuinJSuerS8y6KrZqaZnLW1r8uumWaZoqeytMCO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./john-mitchell-brown-obituary-news.html>&#171;&nbsp;John Mitchell Brown Obituary News: resident of Eastman, Georgia, died age 69, member of Old Daniel B</a>
