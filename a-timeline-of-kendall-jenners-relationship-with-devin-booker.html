Each member of the family has their own impressive career and are featured on the shows Keeping Up With The Kardashians and Hulu’s The Kardashians. Kendall Jenner is no different than the rest of her family in regards to fame. She has found great success in modeling as well as her brand 818 Tequila. Her romantic life is also full of stars, specifically her current boyfriend Devin Booker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Booker is an NBA player for the Phoenix Suns. He has been an All-Star and is considered one of the best players in the league. Jenner and Booker had a bizarre start to their relationship, but ever since 2020 they have been very happy together—except for a brief pause in their relationship this past summer. Here is a timeline of Kendall Jenner’s relationship with basketball star Devin Booker.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Kendall Jenner And Devin Booker’s Relationship Is So Stupidly Complicated</a></span></p><h2 id=devin-booker-dated-jordyn-woods><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Devin Booker Dated Jordyn Woods</span></h2><p>Jordyn Woods is a very controversial topic for Kardashian fans. She is known for being <a href=#>the other woman in Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson’s relationship</a>. She is also formally best friends with Kylie Jenner. Woods also used to date Devin Booker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In May 2018, Booker and Kendall Jenner went on a double date, but they were both there with different people. Booker was with Woods at the time, while Jenner was with basketball player Ben Simmons. Talk about a weird way to meet a future boyfriend.</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner-starts-seeing-devin-booker><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kendall Jenner Starts Seeing Devin Booker</span></h2><p>Almost two years after that double date, Kendall Jenner and Devin Booker begin to be seen together romantically. The couple were seen on a road trip together in April 2020 while they were headed to Sedona, Arizona.</p><p>In a since deleted post, Booker’s ex-girlfriend Jordyn Woods threw shade at the new couple. After they had been seen hanging out, Woods wrote “haha good morning” with a series of trash can emojis in a since-deleted tweet. Fans assumed the tweet was directed towards Jenner and Booker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kendall-jenner-and-devin-booker-were-hooking-up><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kendall Jenner And Devin Booker Were Hooking Up</span></h2><p>Neither Kendall Jenner nor Devin Booker wanted to commit to a relationship too quickly. Both have very busy work lives with Jenner’s modeling career and Booker’s basketball schedule. Instead of diving right in, they decided to keep things casual between them with low commitment.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They’re hooking up, but they’re not serious</a>,” a source revealed to Us Weekly in June 2020. “They both work and travel frequently and don’t find it very realistic to be in an exclusive relationship with one another.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is Kendall Jenner’s NBA Boyfriend Devin Booker Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=devin-booker-celebrated-kendall-jenner-rsquo-s-birthday><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Devin Booker Celebrated Kendall Jenner’s Birthday</span></h2><p>That “no-strings-attached” vibe of their relationship seemed to be thrown out the window very quickly. By November 2020, the two began celebrating larger events together as a couple. Devin Booker was present for Kendall Jenner’s 25th birthday party, and they took plenty of adorable photos together.</p><p>Jenner was channeling Pamela Anderson’s role in Barb Wire for the celebration. In the photo, Jenner and Booker are pressed close together and look like a power couple. Fans love seeing Jenner find love and be so happy.</p><h2 id=jenner-and-booker-went-instagram-official><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jenner And Booker Went Instagram Official</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though everyone knew the two were hooking up, they did not officially confirm that they were in a relationship until February 2021. <a href=#>Kendall Jenner is known for keeping her romantic life private</a>, so fans were not surprised that she waited so long to truly share her love for Devin Booker.</p><p>The couple both posted on Valentine’s Day of that year. Jenner shared a cute photo of her and Booker cuddling on her kitchen counter. Booker chose to share Jenner playing with a dog. Both posts were incredibly sweet and fans loved the romantic content.</p><h2 id=jenner-and-booker-rsquo-s-support-each-other><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jenner And Booker’s Support Each Other</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a celebrity, it is hard to find people who truly support career choices and are good shoulders to lean on. Kendall Jenner and Devin Booker have been that person for each other since the very beginning. Both are incredibly supportive despite their careers being so different.</p><p>Jenner tries to attend as many of Booker’s games as she can, but her schedule can make that difficult. If she is not able to attend, Jenner makes sure to watch every game and check Booker’s score even when she is out of the house. Booker attends many of <a href=#>Jenner’s 818 Tequila events</a> and is very supportive of Jenner expanding her brand.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Back Together?

Their break only lasted for a couple weeks and likely had to do with their busy schedules and inability to spend quality time together.</p><p>Since their break, they have been seen together in the Hamptons and in Napa Valley. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall and Devin are 100 percent back together</a>,” a source close to the couple revealed. “They spent some time apart but are back to a good place and are really happy with each other.”</p><h2 id=will-devin-booker-be-on-the-kardashians><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Will Devin Booker Be On The Kardashians?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being a celebrity and sharing a great deal of her personal life with the public, Kendall Jenner likes to keep certain things about herself private. One specific thing she likes to keep out of the lime light is her romantic life. She previously had a rule on Keeping Up With The Kardashians that she would not film with a boyfriend unless they had been dating for an entire year.</p><p>Though she has been with Devin Booker for well over a year, he will not be featured on Hulu’s The Kardashians. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We’ll see Kendall with her friends more than you did in ‘Keeping Up</a>,’” The Kardashians showrunner told Variety. “But she is keeping her relationship private.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYZqyZorKttc2eZKieXaCyr7DApaNmopWju6a%2B0mapnqSRqbawutKhoKllp57BqXnDnq2ipl2XvLC3xKtm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./apryl-jones-ethnicity-is-she-african-family-ethnicity-background.html>&#171;&nbsp;Apryl Jones Ethnicity | Is She African | Family Ethnicity Background</a>
