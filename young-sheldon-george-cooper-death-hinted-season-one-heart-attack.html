But this was not George's only heart-related ailment during the series. Young Sheldon also teased George’s demise through heart failure during season 5 during his brief emotional affair with their neighbor, Brenda Sparks.</p><p>In the season 5 premiere, Brenda makes an indecent proposal to George, which <strong>leads to his second mini-heart attack. </strong>Despite George living a relatively healthy life since then, he had a <a href=#>heart attack off-screen during season 7,</a> which led to his untimely death.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:24</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_the-breakdown-of-sheldon-cooper-s-parents-paves-the-way-for-young-sheldon-s-biggest-tragedy_bk_a1_v4.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Breakdown Of Sheldon Cooper's Parents Paves The Way For Young Sheldon's Biggest Tragedy">The Breakdown Of Sheldon Cooper's Parents Paves The Way For Young Sheldon's Biggest Tragedy</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Young Sheldon season 7 is planting seeds of distaste in George and Mary Cooper's marriage, which may be a way to prepare for the unavoidable tragedy.</p><h2 id=why-young-sheldon-waited-until-the-very-end-for-george-cooper-39-s-exit>Why Young Sheldon Waited Until The Very End For George Cooper's Exit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_young-sheldon-photos-of-the-cast-then-vs-now_bk_a1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Young Sheldon teased George Cooper's death a few times throughout the series, but they waited until the end of the final season to do it.
