Hearing about bosses or friends who do really well in the market can put dollar signs in our eyes, motivating us to move forward with our own investment portfolios. But success in investing can sometimes be short-lived. It is easy for individuals to be successful in a bull market, but it is hard for individuals to be successful in a bear market. It is even more difficult for individuals to be successful investors when there is a crash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, there are a few superstars out there who make it look downright easy. They weather, or even thrive in, the storms of the market. These individuals are praised in the business world and the media alike. Individuals will try to emulate their stock picks in order to have great results themselves. They will soon find that it is not as easy as it looks to just copy a genius. These investors truly stand in a class of their own when it comes to their actions in the stock market.</p><p>Just like in the NBA or PGA, there are those who are the very best in the entire world. To call yourself the best in the world in anything is a great feat, but to be one of the best investors in the world is a whole different game all together. Individuals who are counted among the best investors in the world not only have massive amounts of money for themselves, but also dictate what happens in so much of the stock market.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So many individuals follow these investing gods’ moves that they can find even small maneuvers making huge ripples, creating huge fluctuations in the price of certain stocks or industries. Here is a list of 1o of the most successful investors in the world.</p><h2 id=edward-johnson-iii---9-3-billiion>10. Edward Johnson, III - $9.3 Billiion</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pretty much everyone has heard of Fidelity investments, and<a title="Edward Johnson Net Worth" href=#> Edward Johnson III</a> is responsible for running this company (with some help from his daughter). Fidelity Investments was started by Johnson's father, and he worked his way up in that company from an entry level research analyst position all the way up to president of the entire company.</p><p>Without Johnson we may not have the discount brokerage market that we have today. He pioneered this discount brokerage market and brought it to smaller investors, banks, insurance companies, and more. Now Fidelity Investments is one of the biggest and most accessible discount brokerage firms in the world, and Edward Johnson III is a man of considerable wealth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=suleiman-kerimov---7-1-billion>9. Suleiman Kerimov - $7.1 Billion</h2><p>The story of <a title="Suleiman Kerimov Net Worth" href=#>Suleiman Kerimov's</a> success is pretty inspirational one. When he was first starting out his career, he worked as an accountant for an electrical plant that made semi conductors and other parts used for circuit boards. He was only making 250 dollars a month, so he and his wife had to live at the workers’ hostel attached to the plant.</p><p>When Kerimov made the leap into banking, he found his investment growing quite rapidly. With that added income that he could throw into investments, he went from being someone on a $250 &nbsp;a month salary to a multi billionaire.</p><p></p><h2 id=august-von-finck---8-4-billion>8. August von Finck - $8.4 Billion</h2><p><a title="August von Finck Net Worth" href=#>August Von Finck</a> has really done well with the cards he has been handed, although he had some of the best cards that you could have been handed: his grandfather started insurance company Allianz and bank Merck, Finck & Co.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1990, Von Finck sold his grandfather’s companies to Barclays Bank. With this money, he started investing heavily. Two of von Finck’s favourites are the real estate and industrial sectors, industries in which he does very well as an investor.</p><p></p><h2 id=harold-simmons---10-billion>7. Harold Simmons - $10 Billion</h2><p><a title="Harold Simmons Net Worth" href=#>Harold Simmons</a> is a big player in the stock market investing game. He is the one who is responsible for creating LBOs, better known as leveraged buy outs. This system of buying so much of a company’s stock that you are its main stockshare holder was uncommon until Harold Simmons hopped onto the scene.</p><p>This helped him create his massive stock empire and amass the billions of dollars that he has today. He also popularized a new manner of purchasing companies that was never in vogue before.</p><p></p><h2 id=philip-anschutz-10-billion>6. Philip Anschutz $ 10 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a title="Philip Anschutz Net Worth" href=#>Phillip Anschutz</a> is a perfect story of American entrepreneurial success. Anschutz decided to buy out his dad's drilling company and start drilling in Wyoming. His profits from drilling in Wyoming were so great that it gave him a perfect amount of money to start investing, and so Anschutz invested in a lot of different stocks, also getting his hand into the real estate market and rail road industry. His success, to the tune of $10 billion, speaks for itself.</p><p>He is also an avid sports lover. He helped start Major League Soccer, and now currently is the owner of a few different soccer teams around the country.</p><p></p><h2 id=mikhail-prokhorov-10-9-billion>5. Mikhail Prokhorov (10.9 Billion</h2><p>Russian native <a title="Mikhail Prokhorov Net Worth" href=#>Mikhail Prokhorov</a> is one of the younger billionaires on our list, aged just 48. Prokhorov made most of his money in commodities. He has been the chairman for Russia's top producers of nickel and palladium, and also of a company that was Russia's largest gold producer.</p><p>Prokhorov is also a big sports fan, and happens to be the owner of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team. Prokhorov now devotes most of his time to politics, but he is still very well -versed in the world of investing due to his very successful past in the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=ronald-perelman---14-billion>4. Ronald Perelman - $14 Billion</h2><p>Wharton School Business Grad <a title="Ronald Perelman Net Worth" href=#>Ronald Perelman</a> took his business knowledge to practice with his investments and found huge success. It’s come, though, at the expense of his family life, evidenced by his being married five times.</p><p>With his MacAndrew & Forbes Holding Company, Perelman has made a fortune investing in everything from Panavision cameras to Revlon cosmetics. Perelman has been smart about diversifying his holdings into different industries, which has been one of the reasons he has been able to amass so much wealth over his investing career.</p><p></p><h2 id=carl-icahn---24-5-billion>3. Carl Icahn - $24.5 Billion</h2><p><a title="Carl Icahn Net Worth" href=#>Carl Icahn</a> is one of the most well known and respected investors in America. As owner of Ichan Enterprises, Ichan has his hands in many different industries in the stock market. Some of the industries that Icahn has invested in are the gaming industry, the rail car industry, food packaging, metals, real estate, and home fashion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These industries have yielded some pretty amazing results for Ichan over the last few years, valuing his holding company, Ichan Enterprises, at $24.5 Billion with over 60,000 employees. He’s recently been a loud voice in the discussion of Apple’s finances.</p><p></p><h2 id=prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud---20-30-billion>2. Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Alsaud - $20-30 Billion</h2><p><a title="Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Net Worth" href=#>Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Alsaud</a> is not only one of the world's best investors, but he has been hailed as the most influential Arab in the world. Alsaud made his massive fortune as the founder and owner of the Kingdom Holding Company. Alsaud invests mainly in Hotels, Real Estate, Finance & Banking, Media, Internet, Technology, and of course Entertainment.</p><p>These investments not only keep this amazing investor busy, but they keep him very rich. By hiring a team of professionals to help run his Kingdom Holding Company, the investments just continue to grow and grow.</p><p></p><h2 id=warren-buffett---58-5-billion>1. Warren Buffett - $58.5 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a title="Warren Buffett Net Worth" href=#>Warren Buffett</a>, known as the Oracle of Omaha, has been hailed as the world's greatest investor for his decades-long success in playing the market. Buffett is synonymous with running amazing business, and making incredible stock picks. Many around the world follow Buffett's every move when it comes to their stock picks.
